# Day 13 Part 2 - Debugging Notes

## Problem Status
- **Part 1**: ✅ SOLVED (109,23)
- **Part 2**: ✅ SOLVED (137,101)

## Solution
The correct answer is **137,101**. Cart 6 is the last remaining cart at tick 12364.

## Root Cause of Initial Wrong Answer
The input file was initially downloaded incorrectly - the first line was missing leading spaces. This caused all implementations to consistently produce 73,122 (wrong answer) instead of the correct 137,101.

## The Bug
- **Problem**: The `cmd/fetch/main.go` script was calling `strings.TrimSpace()` on all downloaded content
- **Impact**: This removed 19 leading spaces from the first line of the Day 13 input file
- **Effect**: All X coordinates were shifted, causing incorrect collision calculations
- **Fix**: Modified the fetch script to only trim whitespace for HTML content, preserving exact formatting for input files
